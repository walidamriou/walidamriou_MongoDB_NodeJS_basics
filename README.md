# walidamriou_MongoDB_NodeJS_basics
A small project to introduce MongoDB with NodeJS

### introduction
__MongoDB__ is a NoSQL database, cross-platform,  and document-oriented database management system (DBMS). It uses documents that are in JSON-like format, known as BSON, which is the binary encoding of JSON. It developed as __an open-source project__ by MongoDB Inc. The motivation to use MongoDB is to implement a data store that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. It is extremely simple to install and implement. also MongoDB is fast for storing certain types.  
MongoDB has it's terminology, to fast familiar with it, here's a quick translation cheat sheet:  

- SQL Server	===> MongoDB  
- Database ===>	Database  (The container that holds a set of collections)  
- Table ===>	Collection  (A set of documents. This is similar to a table in an SQL database. However, unlike an SQL database, a collection does not have a set structure or pre-configured data types)    
- Index ===>	Index  
- Row ===>	Document (A JSON-like object. This is similar to a row in an SQL database. A JSON object may also contain child objects, an array, etc.)   
- Column ===>	Field  
- Joining ===>	Linking & Embedding  
- Partition	Sharding ===> (Range Partition)  
- Replication ===>	ReplSet
