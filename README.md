# walidamriou_MongoDB_NodeJS_basics
A small project to introduce MongoDB with NodeJS

### introduction
__MongoDB__ is a NoSQL database, cross-platform,  and document-oriented database management system (DBMS). It uses documents that are in JSON-like format, known as BSON, which is the binary encoding of JSON. It developed as __an open-source project__ by MongoDB Inc. The motivation to use MongoDB is to implement a data store that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. It is extremely simple to install and implement. also MongoDB is fast for storing certain types. In this project, I have Implemented CRUD Operations (Create, read, update and delete from MongoDB database [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete "see here") ). in MongoDB, we say (Insert, Find, Update, and Delete).  
You can see this Slide from @OlfaKaroui about MongoDB:  [Introduction_to_MongoDB_by_Olfa_Karoui_Jul-6-2020.pdf](https://github.com/walidamriou/walidamriou_MongoDB_NodeJS_basics/blob/main/Documents/Introduction_to_MongoDB_by_Olfa_Karoui_Jul-6-2020.pdf "Introduction_to_MongoDB_by_Olfa_Karoui_Jul-6-2020.pdf")

#### MongoDB terminology
MongoDB has it's terminology, to fast familiar with it, here's a quick translation cheat sheet:  

- SQL Server	===> MongoDB  
- Database ===>	Database  (The container that holds a set of collections)  
- Table ===>	Collection  (A set of documents. This is similar to a table in an SQL database. However, unlike an SQL database, a collection does not have a set structure or pre-configured data types)    
- Index ===>	Index  
- Row ===>	Document (A JSON-like object. This is similar to a row in an SQL database. A JSON object may also contain child objects, an array, etc.)   
- Column ===>	Field  
- Joining ===>	Linking & Embedding  
- Partition	Sharding ===> (Range Partition)  
- Replication ===>	ReplSet
